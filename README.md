# What Remains in Sleep

**What Remains in Sleep** is a 2D narrative puzzle-horror game made in Godot. You wake up in a strange, looping place with no memory of how you got there. Something is wrong. Time is stuck. The walls remember things you do not.

## About the Game

In *What Remains in Sleep*, you play as a lost soul trapped in a shifting, looping memory. Explore a haunted interior space where each run reveals more about your past. Interact with objects to uncover memory fragments, collect hidden items, and piece together the story before the loop resets again.

- **Memory-driven exploration**: Pick up items tied to emotional memories.
- **Loop mechanic**: The environment changes subtly with each loop. There are 3 loops total.
- **Dark narrative**: Each clue brings you closer to the truth — and the tragedy.
- **Environmental storytelling**: Some objects only whisper to you. Others offer tangible fragments of the past.
